1.
Question 1
Overall, how many bits in this structure definition will be used out of the overall structure allocation (as compared to how many are unused or used as padding)?
Struct example {

  uint16_t a:2

  uint16_t b:3

  uint16_t c:4

  uint16_t d;

};


-25 bits are being used


2.
Question 2
Which structure definition represents a singly linked list structure?


-struct node   { 

 uint32_t data; 

 struct node * next; 

 };




3.
Question 3
What is the size of this union definition below given the MSP432 32-bit architecture?
union example {

  uint8_t * ptr;

  uint32_t data;

  uint8_t ** dptr; 

};


-4 bytes

4.
Question 4
Enumeration data sizes are always the size of a word?

-False


5.
Question 5
Enumeration values can range from:


-Factional values from 0.0 to 25.5 incrementing by 0.1
-The unsigned range of the word
-The signed range of a word

6.
Question 6
When designing an abstract data structure, you usually also need to:

-Define the function interfaces for the structure to add, remove, read, or write data
-Ensure proper use of the data structure by checking bounds or even restricting public access to certain internal member variables
-Define the internal structure members of the associated abstruct data structure type



7.
Question 7
Given the circular buffer structure defined below, which code would correctly read the data stored at the head pointer? (Assume the buffer has been initialized)
    typedef struct CircBuf {

      uint32_t length;

      uint8_t * base;

      uint8_t * head;

      uint8_t * tail;

    } CircBuf_t;

   CircBuf_t cb;

   uint8_t data;



-data = *(cb.head);

Question 8
When removing an item to a FIFO buffer, what operations do you need to perform?

-Option 1
-Option 4
-Option 5
