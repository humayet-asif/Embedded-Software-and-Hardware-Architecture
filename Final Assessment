Question 1
List some characteristics of a FIFO Buffer.


-Requires a contiguous block of memory

-Requires a data structure to manage the block of memory


2.
Question 2
True or False: LIFO Buffer instances can be allocated both dynamically and statically.


-True


3.
Question 3
What keyword should be used on the buffer members if it is being used between main and an Interrupt subroutine in a produce consumer model?

-volatile


4.
Question 4
Enumerations...


-Can be used to define a data structure


-Can define numerous constants of the same value


-Can be used to define error codes


-Are usually defined with lower case letters


-Have a size that is Architecture dependent (EABI)




5.
Question 5
Encapsulation is important to use with data structures because


-It forces interaction with the structure to happen only in provided routines protecting from incorrect use


-It reduces the opportunity to introducing bugs to using a data structure


-It ensures that structure members are accessed through consistent methods using an interface


-It often provides get and set operations for data structures


6.
Question 6
True or False: Bit field use implicitly uses bit manipulation.

-True
